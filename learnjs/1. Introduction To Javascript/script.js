/*  Javascript is developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich to make the web pages live. It is first named Livescript and then renamed to Javascript as java was popular at that time
That's a quick history about javascript. Let's know know how to declare variables in javascript.

In javascript variables can be declared using three keywords. They are:
 1. let
 2. const
 3. var
 
 let and var:
   There is very less difference between let and var. var is used in olden days but you can use let to declare variables.

 const:
   Variables declare using const keyword can't be changed once they are assigned a value. So we must assign a value while declaring a variable using const

let name = "John Alec";
const age = 20;

name = "Harry" // No error
age = 34  // Error
