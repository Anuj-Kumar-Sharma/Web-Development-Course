      A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a type of
      <mark>Digital Ledger Technology (DLT)</mark> that
      <del>consists</del> comprises of growing list of records, called blocks,
      that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup
        >[1][2][3][4]</sup
      >
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
      timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,
      where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the
      transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block
      contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form
      a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
      linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
      cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

      <br /><br />Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
      computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes
      collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate
      new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable,
      since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure
      by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
      fault tolerance.[5]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
      secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
      Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to implement a system wherein document
      timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
      Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
      efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
      one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
      hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since
      1995.[14]

      <br /><br />The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a
      person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto
      improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to
      timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party
      and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which
      blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following
      year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where
      it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]

        <h2>Key TakeAways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical
          database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in
          blocks linked together via cryptography.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the
          most common use for transactions has been as a ledger.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is decentralized so that no single
          person or group has control—instead, all users collectively retain
          control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data
          entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, transactions are permanently
          recorded and viewable to anyone.
